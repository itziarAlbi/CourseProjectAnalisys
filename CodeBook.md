PROJECT - POINT 5- VARIABLES IN TIDY DATA SET

Subject :Identifies the person who performed the activity. Its range is from 1 to 30.

Activity :Activity names. It takes one of the following values: Standing, Sitting, Laying, Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs.

The following lines calculate the mean of each variable according to Subject and Activity. 

For instance, first record of output text file is 1 Training Laying 0.22159824394 -0.0405139534294 ... That means that for subject identified as "1", for training data set and the laying activity, the mean of TimeBodyAccMeanX is 0.22159824394, the mean of TimeBodyAccMeanY is -0.0405139534294 and so on for each column
